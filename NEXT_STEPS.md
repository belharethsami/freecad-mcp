# Next Steps

## Planned Features

1. **Separate Ground Truth and Created Object Display**
   
   A new mechanism for displaying the ground truth and the created object, and have the ability to rotate and maneuver each independently.

2. **Distance Measurement Between Arbitrary Points**
   
   Brainstorm methods for best determining the distance between two arbitrary parts of the STL mesh, especially when not all surfaces are visible externally. Some form of transparency or an "x-ray" view of sorts may be necessary.
